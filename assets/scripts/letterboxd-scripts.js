This movie focuses more on the human story, and Godzilla feels more like a force of destruction than a character, which for me makes the story so much more engaging and detailed. Everything from the way this movie was shot, to the design of Godzilla, to the soundtrack and sound design, was incredible. This was also the first and probably last Godzilla movie to make me cry, because the human story of survivor's guilt was so wonderfully written and told. Also the captain is by far the best character in the movie, his charisma resonated with a strength that could power an entire city.

I'll admit my opinions on this movie will always be skewed upwards from nostalgia, but I'm not gonna hold that back because this movie deserves it all. The soundtrack is once again an absolute masterpiece from John Williams, and it gives me all those wonderful Star Wars vibes. This movie has all the same Indiana Jones antics that I love to see, from the repeated love interest, to the punch sound effects, and the Nazi fights. There are so many bits in this movie that I will always remember; the \"No Ticket\" scene, the fireplace scene, the tank fight, Marcus Brody's \"escape\", hell the whole movie. I love the comedy in this, and how it's amplified by Sean Conery's performance. And I absolutely just adore everything else.

He ironically talked quite a bit about how one does not talk about Fight Club. So what did I know about this movie? That there was a fight club. Probably some underground fighting ring. I was expecting something like that fighting arena in Shang Chi, and was expecting this movie to be more action-based. Almost like a rated M Karate Kid. But boy was I wrong. Turns out the fight club of Fight Club is just the step stool you use to reach your mom's stash of the good shit in the back of the medicine cabinet. Because that's what it felt like watching this movie. It's been a while since a plot twist got me as well as this one's did, and I found myself genuinely engaged in everything and everyone. The way the story was told, with the usage of self narration and the slow yet subtle hints to the truth of the matter makes finding out what happened so much more appealing, because it was right in front of you the entire time.

And although I already knew of how great Willem Dafoe is, he really worked overtime in this one to go absolutely crazy.

Then it turns out when you watch it even more on CD, then online, it ages like fine wine sealed with the wax of that melted Nazi. This movie is genuinely just iconic to me, it's almost perfect in every general way. Honestly I'd say this movie became a sort of archetype to what I like out of movies: enticing action, mystery, and spliced-in comedy.

The fact that Keanu Reeves received and proceed to excel in real military training for this role, then proceeded to show throughout this movie so many realistic moments of gunplay made me so happy throughout this movie. Not to mention, John Wick being in Fortnite indirectly created a massive series of skits and short films I'd later make until a Spanish or German John Wick was damn near my persona.

I love the pacing and the way this movie set up the conflict, with a very realistic and cruel depiction of the killer. The manner of which Leatherface killed them, in a panicked yet efficient way, made it feel all the more terrifying to see. My only real complaint is that the movie's initial credit-roll mentioned there was a survivor, as that removed most of the tension from the final chase scene. Overall, justice for Franklin." },

I also love that Max didn't end up joining Vincent or becoming a criminal as well. I expected it would as it seems to be typical, but it was refreshing to see that his encounter with Vincent  only seemed to bring out the stronger side of Max's personality.

But I was very pleasantly surprised by this movie as a whole. This is one of those movies that ages like fine wine, as you can see it's influence in modern day media the older it gets. So many plot elements and shots I recognize from some of my favorite moments in Star Wars properties, and it's also very cool to see the origin of the attack, wait, then die trope for fighting (a popular of example of that being used is in the unfortunately bad Resident Evil movie, with the lasers). However the thing that really got me into this movie was the comedy. Some intentional and some not, there were many moments in this movie that made me laugh out loud, and I found myself genuinely enjoying the personalities of the characters. Overall, I should invest in coffins." },

To say this movie had an impact on sci-fi movies to come would be an understatement, and it will definitely be a movie people remember for a while. I'd say my favorite aspect of this film is definitely the effects. They were truly ahead of their time and do a great job of adding to the feeling of surrealness. With that being said, my main issues with this film center around specific aspects of the story. I wasn't majorly compelled by the story, but it was in general a solid one. Neo is also a good and well-written character, with a well-done Luke Skywalker-esq training arc, but it's nothing mind-blowing. The main story beat I have an issue with is the ending, where Trinity's love for Neo was shown to be the thing that brings him back to life in the real world after dying in the Matrix left him effectively brain-dead. I found the idea that true love brought Neo back to life to be corny and very out of place in the world created for the Matrix, which was otherwise grounded in a sci-fi setting. As such my experience for the ending was negatively impacted as that scene left a bitter taste in my mouth afterwards. However, I will reiterate that this scene does not ruin the movie as a whole, and it's still an incredible film to watch. Overall, I'd take the blue pill (I like steak)." },

        "rating": "This movie makes Among Us look like a game of tag. For an obvious reason (it being shot in the 80s in the snow), this movie gave me constant Hoth vibes from empire strikes back, and any movie that does that already has my vote. I'm not a gore guy, and this game truly had some next-level gore, but it honestly added to the horror of the movie. I liked the characters, and I loved the vibe the movie gave off (through the lighting, the shots, and the overall settings). However, this movie definitely would've gotten at least another half a star if the characters weren't so stupid. I thought they'd play it smart at first, but the deaths from splitting up at the end really spoiled that for me. Overall, I'll never forgive the Norwegians." },

With that being said, the primary things holding this movie back in my opinion are the story and pacing during many portions during the middle.

This show, and many other anime, tend to have all emotions expressed to the extreme, which for me causes the value of those emotions to deteriorate, especially over multiple seasons.

This movie was enjoyable thanks to some very well-done shots, but mostly thanks to the intelligence of the characters throughout (once again, smart people being smart in movies makes me happy).

I also didn't like the way the movie ended story-wise, which I understand is due to Vol. 2 being released at the same time: a creative decision that I personally don't like.

I was very compelled by the boot camp storyline with Vincent D'Onofrio, who I had only ever seen play Wilson Fisk before, and I was fully expecting to like this movie quite a bit for that.

My food was a 4 slices of dominos cheese pizza. Overall not much to say about the movie other than it was pretty good. Got a little boring towards the ending." },

        "rating": "First off It's the same actor as the guy who played john knash or nash in inside a beautiful mind and it took a minute to adjust because of it, which is fine. The music was alright although wasn't anything crazy. The characters didn't mean much to me at first. Took some time for me to actually start liking them. Padeen and the boy with one arm were the best characters. The movies plot was alright it was engaging enough. The ambience though was the best part of the movie. It just felt really nice. My snack was both a bowl of cheez-its and 5 pieces of french toast. Overall that's all there is to really say about the movie. Was pretty good." },

I don't have much to say other than it is an alright movie. The snack for my movie was was 2 bowls of lays salt and vinegar chips. Overall it was an alright movie." },

        "rating": "pretty good movie. The main character was very entertaining. All the characters were all pretty cool. Music was a little un-noticable though. The ending made me furious and it was sad. Like most of the movie, the deaths were really sad. My food for the movie was a calzone and a half of another one, which was 3 cheese. Overall a pretty good movie." },

        "rating": "Alright movie. The effects were really bad but thats the only real major flaw about the movie. And even then I can see it being intentional. The music was really good at times it did nice to add to the movie. The plot was alright but were the movie really shines is the humor and characters. The characters are very colorful and the jokes are relatively good. My snack for this movie was half a cup of xtra cheddar goldfish. Overall I liked the movie however somethings a little off-putting. I can't say why. But the movie was nice." },
    { "movie": "The Thing (1982)", "stars": "3/5", "liked": "Not Liked", "rating": "A few things to say about this movie. The music was very mid, the sound effects sound very muffled and not clean at all even if old. The practical effects are good but very gross; very wet. I do not think the whole man vs unknown was executed alright, however not to my liking. Didn't like how it was executed. The characters were both good and bad. Blair was cool but annoying in some parts, Childs was very cool, but Mac is the star of the show. Watching this the second time was definitely better than the first time, has my attention span has gotten way better than it was my first time watching it. My snack was a few pretzels and overall the movie was alright. I found the first hour to be very entertaining but the last 40 min were a little boring to me. The characters were especially stupid in the end of the movie with splitting up constantly and not communicating, was just wack. Overall (Again) I say this movie is alright." },
    { "movie": "Kill Bill: Vol. 1", "stars": "3/5", "liked": "Not Liked", 
        "rating": "Movie felt like a short anime. The music was on point besides the final fight music. The fight vs the girl with the mace was the best fight scene. Didn't like the feet shots and rape is a no no. Ion like it. Animation scenes were hype although they were cluttered with lines amongst the ridges. The fact people got away with so much murder is wack. The fight scene with the 40thousand people was just way too long and it was ridiculous how dumb the men were acting. Two or three at a time then quitting. My snack was literally just 3 or 4 nacho cheese doritos. Overall better than the terminator, and a decent movie." },
    { "movie": "John Wick", "stars": "3/5", "liked": "Not Liked", 
        "rating": "This movie was alright. Just about what I'd expect it to be, just an action movie. The plot was alright it was what it needed to be. Music was kind of iffy don't recall much pieces. The pacing was fast in the begininng but towards the ending the movie went on for far too long. Felt like it was dragging itself out. Which it'd be fine but it didn't feel too engaging. At least ever since the bath scene Imo. My snack was a three cheese calzone and a half of one. Overall a movie but it felt very average." },

It's a sequel in a sense mario 3 is a sequel to super mario bros. Same format, same actors, just a different plot. My snack was lays salt and vinegar chips with helluva french onion dip. Anyway this movies wasn't too bad for what I have seen. Although I must admit I have not really like the first movie so much." },
