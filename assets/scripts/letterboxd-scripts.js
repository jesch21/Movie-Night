This movie focuses more on the human story, and Godzilla feels more like a force of destruction than a character, which for me makes the story so much more engaging and detailed. Everything from the way this movie was shot, to the design of Godzilla, to the soundtrack and sound design, was incredible. This was also the first and probably last Godzilla movie to make me cry, because the human story of survivor's guilt was so wonderfully written and told. Also the captain is by far the best character in the movie, his charisma resonated with a strength that could power an entire city.

The soundtrack is once again an absolute masterpiece from John Williams, and it gives me all those wonderful Star Wars vibes. This movie has all the same Indiana Jones antics that I love to see, from the repeated love interest, to the punch sound effects, and the Nazi fights. There are so many bits in this movie that I will always remember; the \"No Ticket\" scene, the fireplace scene, the tank fight, Marcus Brody's \"escape\", hell the whole movie.

I can understand the hate for much of Disney's Star Wars output, but this movie alone will always justify them being made. This movie is absolutely stunning, with some of the best visuals in any Star Wars medium. It's also the first Star Wars movie I've seen with genuine comedy that I quite enjoy, and that tackles some more serious themes surrounding the Alliance and the rebel effort, muddying the waters and making the Rebels seem like they're not all good. I also absolutely love this story and how it's executed, with all the character deaths being executed in such an impactful manor that it gets me every time I see it. And don't even get me started with Vader's hallway scene. That is truly the best and most intimidating scene of Vader, and in so little time instilled pure and total fear into the audience as they watched him murder rebels with absolute ease. This movie is the only star wars movies I've currently seen more than once in theaters, and it's one of the few to earn that privilege. Overall, it's safe to say Krennic choked on his aspirations."},

I was expecting something like that fighting arena in Shang Chi, and was expecting this movie to be more action-based. Almost like a rated M Karate Kid. But boy was I wrong. Turns out the fight club of Fight Club is just the step stool you use to reach your mom's stash of the good shit in the back of the medicine cabinet. Because that's what it felt like watching this movie. It's been a while since a plot twist got me as well as this one's did, and I found myself genuinely engaged in everything and everyone.

This movie is genuinely just iconic to me, it's almost perfect in every general way. Honestly I'd say this movie became a sort of archetype to what I like out of movies: enticing action, mystery, and spliced-in comedy.

The fact that Keanu Reeves received and proceed to excel in real military training for this role, then proceeded to show throughout this movie so many realistic moments of gunplay made me so happy throughout this movie.

The manner of which Leatherface killed them, in a panicked yet efficient way, made it feel all the more terrifying to see.

So many plot elements and shots I recognize from some of my favorite moments in Star Wars properties, and it's also very cool to see the origin of the attack, wait, then die trope for fighting (a popular of example of that being used is in the unfortunately bad Resident Evil movie, with the lasers).

However, I will say there were a few moments in which I felt certain character decisions stopped making as much sense (mostly in the end) as a means of dragging the scene's tension out more.

To say this movie had an impact on sci-fi movies to come would be an understatement, and it will definitely be a movie people remember for a while. I'd say my favorite aspect of this film is definitely the effects. They were truly ahead of their time and do a great job of adding to the feeling of surrealness. With that being said, my main issues with this film center around specific aspects of the story. I wasn't majorly compelled by the story, but it was in general a solid one. Neo is also a good and well-written character, with a well-done Luke Skywalker-esq training arc, but it's nothing mind-blowing. The main story beat I have an issue with is the ending, where Trinity's love for Neo was shown to be the thing that brings him back to life in the real world after dying in the Matrix left him effectively brain-dead. I found the idea that true love brought Neo back to life to be corny and very out of place in the world created for the Matrix, which was otherwise grounded in a sci-fi setting. As such my experience for the ending was negatively impacted as that scene left a bitter taste in my mouth afterwards. However, I will reiterate that this scene does not ruin the movie as a whole, and it's still an incredible film to watch. Overall, I'd take the blue pill (I like steak)." },

I liked the characters, and I loved the vibe the movie gave off (through the lighting, the shots, and the overall settings).

And I'm once again not a fan of the trend of 'the power of love saving them', although it was better this time since it was more like he restarted her heart with electricity.

First and foremost, this movie still failed to provide me with some reassuring idea or information about how Neo now has real life superpowers, instead making it even more crazy by blinding him and giving him full-on Daredevil vision. Secondly, some of the fights and effects seemed a bit repeated or unnecessary. I felt the initial scene of Neo being trapped in the train station played out in a way that made it seem almost unnecessary with how quickly it was resolved, seeming like it was almost placed there for the specific purpose of giving the others an excuse to fight. I liked many of the moments in the final matrix fight, and thoroughly enjoyed the last stand in Zion, but they repeated a few moves in the fight against Smith that sort of took away from the impact of each move. On top of that, I think they kinda overdid it with the rain and thunder, it got kinda hard to follow certain scenes in there.

This show, and many other anime, tend to have all emotions expressed to the extreme, which for me causes the value of those emotions to deteriorate, especially over multiple seasons. I enjoyed the mystery behind it, and the animations is very well done, but I think this system was the primary reason behind the fact that this show did not resonate with me on an emotional level.

I went into this expecting the old-feeling historical character study, and in the beginning that's what I was getting, only really amplified by the charm of the main characters. However, the plot twist did add quite a bit of quality for me. I very much liked this movies depiction of schizophrenia, and many of those scenes were very compelling to watch. Despite this, I believe the pacing was very slow, and even after picking up with the schizophrenia reveal, I believe it went on for far too long afterwards before the conclusion. Overall, despite these problems this movie was not a waste of our - and what is infinitely worse - my time." },

In a way, I was right on both ends. This movie was enjoyable thanks to some very well-done shots, but mostly thanks to the intelligence of the characters throughout (once again, smart people being smart in movies makes me happy).

Although the writing isn't great in many ways, and the movie often feels like it dives a bit more into the more nuanced politics that many others, it has a certain charm to it that makes me enjoy watching it regardless. The few lightsaber fights it has are very well choreographed, and honestly I gotta say I kinda like Jar Jar. The biggest injustice is how they treated Darth Maul. He was way too cool of a Sith to have like 3 speaking lines. Finally I don't get the midichlorian hate, it's totally fine to me.

I also didn't like the way the movie ended story-wise, which I understand is due to Vol. 2 being released at the same time: a creative decision that I personally don't like.

For a war-based movie, the only aspects that typically catch my eye are comedy and action, and although I recognize that neither were the focus of this film, it doesn't change that I didn't like their absence.

Similar to Godzilla Minus One, this movie uses the monster more as a means of destruction rather than the main character, which allows for more development of the characters. With that being said however, I wasn't very interested in much of the characters. I didn't find myself caring for them too much, and the story itself was both predictable and uninteresting.

On top of that, the decision to market Finn as the Jedi, only to make it Rey was just not right at all.

I was very compelled by the boot camp storyline with Vincent D'Onofrio, who I had only ever seen play Wilson Fisk before, and I was fully expecting to like this movie quite a bit for that. But I wasn't a fan that this story was cut short, then an entirely different and far less compelling story played out to finish the film.

The only aspect of this movie that stood out to me was Ernest's acting, especially in the scenes where he cut between multiple different personalities.

If that show didn't exist I would truly hate Anakin's character, and this movie is largely the reason for it.

Everything to do with Luke Skywalker in this film is miserable. His decision to immediately try and kill his own nephew the moment he has visions of his darkness is unbelievably stupid and nothing like the Luke Skywalker who let himself get electrocuted by Palpatine out of confidence that his father still had good in him. His decision to end the Jedi order in turn is even stupider, especially leaving his mistake with Kylo unresolved. I've seen some make this comparison to the actions of Obi-Wan and Yoda, but unlike those two Luke wasn't being hunted by a Galactic Empire. It's absolutely ridiculous. On top of that, the way he acted was just miserable and uninteresting, and the fact that he still never even leaves the island, instead just projecting himself to the planet. Add to that the fact that it kills him? Even stupider. The final note to that, why the hell is there a map to Luke Skywalker? The only way that makes sense is if he made it himself, so why would he give it to some random guy on Jakku if he didn't want to be found? Anyway, next part. What they did with the fleet, killing Admiral Ackbar, doing a weird fake-out death for Leia ending in some absolutely ridiculous force stunt that comes out of nowhere and makes basically no sense at all, made even worse by what they do after it. Admiral Hondo is absolutely one of the stupidest character decisions I've seen in a while. I mean what logic is there behind her deciding not to tell Poe what they're planning to do, or even that they had a plan. The whole fleet coup scene is made so annoying by the fact that it's truly not controversial. The movie doesn't seem to even treat Hondo as the problem, they still act like Poe was the hot-shot flyboy problem the whole time. Anyway, let's keep going. I don't like the character decision in episode 7 to make Finn's character essentially just constantly addicted to Rey. And they did nothing better here. His whole story that he went on with Rose, a character that felt entirely pointless and forced in, was also genuinely horrible. It really felt like they tried some weird political shit from Canto Bite that not only wasn't good, but also made little sense at all. The entire planet side-mission felt unnecessary and dragged out to a ridiculous degree... (cont. on letterboxd)" },

Could've been crazy good, could've been hype, but instead this movie just doubles down on insulting Star Wars.

But overall the movie was pretty darn good. Also my snack for the movie was a 6 inch turkey sub from subway, and a few handfuls of watermelon sour patch kids." },

The practical effects are good but very gross; very wet. I do not think the whole man vs unknown was executed alright, however not to my liking. Didn't like how it was executed. The characters were both good and bad. Blair was cool but annoying in some parts, Childs was very cool, but Mac is the star of the show. Watching this the second time was definitely better than the first time, has my attention span has gotten way better than it was my first time watching it. My snack was a few pretzels and overall the movie was alright. I found the first hour to be very entertaining but the last 40 min were a little boring to me. The characters were especially stupid in the end of the movie with splitting up constantly and not communicating, was just wack. Overall (Again) I say this movie is alright." },

The fact people got away with so much murder is wack. The fight scene with the 40thousand people was just way too long and it was ridiculous how dumb the men were acting.
