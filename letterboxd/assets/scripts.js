Where Suicide Squad failed, James Gunn had The Suicide Squad not only succeed, but excel. The comedy is perfectly timed and written, and the writing is done so well to make me care and be invested in characters as niche as Polka Dot man.

The comedy was perfectly written and timed, Gustave was played excellently (very strange to hear Voldemort again).

But nonetheless I absolutely adored it. The performances were incredible, the mystery was setup beautifully, and the writing was awesome. I had heard that Matt Reeves had used Se7en for inspiration when writing the story around his Riddler, and I can see that all throughout this film, which definitely adds to my opinion on it." },

He ironically talked quite a bit about how one does not talk about Fight Club. So what did I know about this movie? That there was a fight club. Probably some underground fighting ring. I was expecting something like that fighting arena in Shang Chi, and was expecting this movie to be more action-based. Almost like a rated M Karate Kid. But boy was I wrong. Turns out the fight club of Fight Club is just the step stool you use to reach your mom's stash of the good shit in the back of the medicine cabinet. Because that's what it felt like watching this movie. It's been a while since a plot twist got me as well as this one's did, and I found myself genuinely engaged in everything and everyone. The way the story was told, with the usage of self narration and the slow yet subtle hints to the truth of the matter makes finding out what happened so much more appealing, because it was right in front of you the entire time. Overall, I promise I won't talk about it." },

Then it turns out when you watch it even more on CD, then online, it ages like fine wine sealed with the wax of that melted Nazi. This movie is genuinely just iconic to me, it's almost perfect in every general way. Honestly I'd say this movie became a sort of archetype to what I like out of movies: enticing action, mystery, and spliced-in comedy. Because who doesn't like talking about how Harrison Ford actually had food poisoning in that one scene, creating one of the most riff-able and iconic standoff scenes I've ever seen.

But John Wick tickles a very particle fancy of mine that I didn't know existed until I saw it: realistic action. The fact that Keanu Reeves received and proceed to excel in real military training for this role, then proceeded to show throughout this movie so many realistic moments of gunplay made me so happy throughout this movie. Not to mention, John Wick being in Fortnite indirectly created a massive series of skits and short films I'd later make until a Spanish or German John Wick was damn near my persona.

Fuckshit, Fourth Grade, Ray, even Rueben and Ian. Their interactions were really well written and it was fun to see stevie grow even if it was a short period of time. I had no stale lays salt and vinegar chips for a snack but I did not eat any of them. Overall I pretty good movie." },

The music was alright although wasn't anything crazy. The characters didn't mean much to me at first. Took some time for me to actually start liking them. Padeen and the boy with one arm were the best characters. The movies plot was alright it was engaging enough. The ambience though was the best part of the movie. It just felt really nice. My snack was both a bowl of cheez-its and 5 pieces of french toast. Overall that's all there is to really say about the movie. Was pretty good." },

The music was really good at times it did nice to add to the movie. The plot was alright but were the movie really shines is the humor and characters. The characters are very colorful and the jokes are relatively good. My snack for this movie was half a cup of xtra cheddar goldfish. Overall I liked the movie however somethings a little off-putting. I can't say why. But the movie was nice." },

        "rating": "Movie felt like a short anime. The music was on point besides the final fight music. The fight vs the girl with the mace was the best fight scene. Didn't like the feet shots and rape is a no no. Ion like it. Animation scenes were hype although they were cluttered with lines amongst the ridges. The fact people got away with so much murder is wack. The fight scene with the 40thousand people was just way too long and it was ridiculous how dumb the men were acting. Two or three at a time then quitting. My snack was literally just 3 or 4 nacho cheese doritos. Overall better than the terminator, and a decent movie." },

Music was kind of iffy don't recall much pieces. The pacing was fast in the begininng but towards the ending the movie went on for far too long. Felt like it was dragging itself out. Which it'd be fine but it didn't feel too engaging. At least ever since the bath scene Imo. My snack was a three cheese calzone and a half of one. Overall a movie but it felt very average." },
